#HUman-Computer Interactions: An Exploration of Design
###Good Design, Bad Design
Our first project was an analysis of good and poorly designed elements of our own school website:

###Design for Others
Our next project was an exploration into designing websites for very specific demographics, and how that may effect the entire design process: https://medium.com/@simonredding_21579/design-for-others-a-demographic-specific-redesign-of-technocopia-org-b86b042553e6

###Design for Understanding
Next, we studied data visualization and the design tricks that can be used to present data either accurately or in whatever best lights a point you are trying to make. https://medium.com/@simonredding_21579/design-for-understanding-an-analysis-of-visualization-techniques-4b2d1bbc20d9

###Design for Tension
We then created a chatbot with the goal of convincing a user of something controversial: in our case, we had ours discuss Artificial Intelligence in the modern world. This allowed us to analyze how designs must change when presenting information that a user may not agree with or want to hear. https://medium.com/@simonredding_21579/design-for-tension-chatbot-592b2d4713d6

###Design for Wellbeing
We continued our exploration of design with a new project: building a website that could actively respond to the user's emotions, with the ultimate goal of making them happy! For this we created a platform that would enhance a user's experience as they watched videos by changing the surrounding website's colors to coincide with their emotions. https://medium.com/@simonredding_21579/design-for-wellbeing-f1e89a95862d

###Design for Another World
This brings us to our final project: Design for Another World. In this project, we created an entirely new world using Google Cardboard VR and Unity, with the goal of transporting the user into an enchanted forest, letting them enter into another realm entirely. https://medium.com/@simonredding_21579/design-for-another-world-4b02622a1d50

##Final Design Manifesto
Throughout this course, we have studied many different aspects and applications of design, and HCI as a whole. I've learned a lot about human-computer interactions, and have compiled some of my thoughts into a single manifesto:





You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/sgredding/HCI-B2018-Portfolio/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sgredding/HCI-B2018-Portfolio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
